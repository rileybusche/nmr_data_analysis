Loop through all files using glob now

write search algorithm to find highest values near peaks.
    -   maybe re construct a graph from intensity values? 

Use regex to differentiate between numbered files and Diffusion gradient file?

--path "/Users/rileybusche/Research/LVR_DIFFUSION_pH10.10_Trial_1/*.txt"

glob.glob('./[0-9].txt')
path = args['path'] + '/*[0-99].txt'

/Users/rileybusche/research_test/ph_10
